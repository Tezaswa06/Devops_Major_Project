# **Library Management System**
## Description
A full-stack Library Management System project, utilizing React, JavaScript, Spring Boot, and MySQL. This system offers a comprehensive user experience, particularly tailored for students. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the features:<br/>
**Student Registration and Login:** Students can easily register and log in to access their personalized profiles.<br/>
**Profile Management:** Once logged in, students can view their profile, which includes a button to explore various book categories like Science Fiction and more.<br/>
**Book Browsing and Selection:** Students can browse through the different book categories and view a list of books available in each category. They have the option to add books of interest to their profile.<br/>
**Personalized Book List:** The added books are displayed in the studentâ€™s profile. If a book is no longer needed, the student can easily delete it from their list.<br/>
**CRUD Operations:** The system efficiently handles Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations, ensuring smooth data management and user interaction.<br/>
This project demonstrates my ability to integrate frontend and backend technologies to create a seamless and interactive user experience. I'm excited to share this accomplishment and look forward to applying these skills to future projects.
